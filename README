To use pyEdm as a stand-alone display:

setenv EDMCOLORFILE /where/my/edm/color/file/is/located/colors.list
# e.g.  setenv EDMCOLORFILE /home/epics/edmBase1-10f/colors.list

python -m edm test.edl

macros can be set on the command line:

python -m edm -m PREFIX=BOC0000:101 userScreen.edl

displays the first CLS bakeout controller.

If an edm class has not been implemented, pyedm will still run, but will
leave a blank area for that class.

It is possible to use the module to embed an EDM window within a QT application.
This particular example is from PyQt4 using the epicsConnectLib, being shared
with the python or C or C++ application. Recommendation is that pyedm should
be embedded by design and not by afterthought, and that the application uses
the pyedm PV library - this allows use of CALC and LOC process variables in
the application!
