Test directory for edm screens.

The file 'test.db' can be run from softIoc to provide PV's for the test files. This should be changed
to have a prefix on all the PV's to avoid conflicts.

The files testDisplay.edl, testMonitor.edl, and testControl.edl cover the different widgets available
with edm 1-10-f. They use the PV's from test.db. Most of the other files are included either directly
or indirectly by the test edl files.
