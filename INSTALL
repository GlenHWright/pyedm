pyEdm depends on at least version 3.6 python. setup.py doesn't enforce this.

pyEdm, as distributed, uses pyEpics version 3 from cars.uchicago.edu. Only
the file edmPVepics.py uses this module directly, and it is possible to over-ride
just this module for different python+EPICS access. Good Luck.

At this time, pyEdm is pure python code.

To install:
it is highly recommended that a python virtual environment is used.


assuming bash:
	git clone https://github.lightsource.ca/cid/TOOL_edmPython.git
	python3 -m venv ${SOMEDIRECTORY}/edmPython
	source ${SOMEDIRECTORY}/edmPython/bin/activate.sh
	python3 setup.py install

alternative:
	python3 -m venv ${SOMEDIRECTORY}/edmPython
	python3 -m pip install epics-pyedm
