pyEdm depends on at least version 2.5 python. setup.py doesn't enforce this.

pyEdm, as distributed, uses pyEpics version 3 from cars.uchicago.edu. Only
the file edmPVepics.py uses this module directly, and it is possible to over-ride
just this module for different python+EPICS access. Good Luck.

At this time, pyEdm is pure python code.

To install:
you must have write permission in $PYTHONHOME/lib/python2.5/site-packages

python setup.py install
